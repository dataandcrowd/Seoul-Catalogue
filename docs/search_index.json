This site offers a handful of geospatial data of Seoul, including population, housing, landuse, industry, traffic, society, hospitality, and environment. Feel free to browse through this book, and drop me a note if you have any enquiries.

Within the Si(city) scale, Seoul has 25 administrative districts, gu, of which the spatial size is similar to the boroughs in London. The river Han penetrates horizontally through the city centre, from east to west, which divides 14 gus to the north, and 11 to the south. "],["spatial-boundary.html", "Chapter 2 Spatial Boundary 2.1 Administrative District (Gu) 2.2 Census tracts (Dong) 2.3 Administrative Census Block (Jipgegu)", " Chapter 2 Spatial Boundary 2.1 Administrative District (Gu) Gu, is a sub-municipal unit in South Korea. Gu is normally regulated when a city has at least a population of 500,000 persons. Seoul has 25 gus, of which the area and population varies. Seocho has the largest area (47\\(km^2\\)) whereas Jung has the smallest (9.96\\(km^2\\)). Songpa and Jung are the most and least populated areas, which are approximately 640,830 and 117,781 persons. To find out more see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_districts_of_Seoul. Figure 2.1: Districts(Gu) in Seoul 2.2 Census tracts (Dong) Dong, known as census tracts, are the smallest boundary of which the authority is owned by the urban government. Each gu comprises two types of boundaries as Hengjeong dongs and Beopjeong dongs. Hengjeong dongs, sub-municipal districts, were established for administrative convenience, such as resident registration. These dongs could be consolidated, divided, or founded due to population increase or decrease e.g. Jongno 1-2-3-4ga dong. Beopjeong dongs, legal districts, are towns or villages that were left for historical significance (Legal dongs were based on cadastral maps made from the Land investigation project during the Japanese colonial years). Due to its historial and symbolic meanings, people tend to remember the names easier than administrative ones. As of 2014, Seoul has 424 administrative dongs and 467 legal dongs. Gildong in Songpa district was most populated area in 2014 at 49,535 persons, whereas Sogongdong in Jung district was the least populated at 735 persons. Figure 2.2: Census tracts(Dong) in Gangnam 2.3 Administrative Census Block (Jipgegu) The finest scale is Jipgegu, or census block. This boundary is mainly to retrieve the population from a minimum statistical area, thus does not function as an administrative unit. Each Jipgegu consists of 60-500 residents, and the boundaries are renewed every year. As of 2013, Seoul has 16,470 jipgegus. All boundary data were provided in a shapefile in a 5-year period from 1975-2015, except the Jipgegu where the last update was in 2016. Figure 2.3: Census block(Jipgyegu) in Gangnam "],["population.html", "Chapter 3 Population 3.1 Population Census 3.2 De Facto Population", " Chapter 3 Population 3.1 Population Census The population of Seoul and the great metropolitan area Sudo-gwon, has increased consistently as the national economy developed, where high demand of job, education, and public transport have been created. Korean’s rapid urbanisation affected the rural citizens migrate to the Sudo-gwon area, resulting in reformations in administrative boundaries. Have a look at the census table below: Figure 3.1: Sudo-gwon(Great) metropolitan area The rate of population growth in the period 1975-2015 is shown in [Figure 3.2]. The yellow bars account for the overall population in South Korea in every 5 years. The blue and green line shows the rate of the population in the Sudogwon and the non-Sudogwon respectively. It clearly shows that the population around Seoul has gradually increased from around 30% to 49.5% in 40 years. In 1975, the total population in the Sudogwon area was just over 30%, then rose to around 45% in 1995. The figures continued to increase until it reached 49.5% in the 2015 census. It is therefore clear that people have constantly migrated to Seoul since 1975, and if these patterns continue, migration to Sudogwon is likely to outstrip migration to Non-Sudogwon in the coming years. Figure 3.2: Temporal patterns of population rate between Sudogwon and Non-Sudogwon area 3.2 De Facto Population De facto population is a recently introduced, estimated population based on LTE mobile data. This data is designed to capture real-time population by receiving signals from nearby stations every hour, by census block to district scale. Recent news says that the LTE users have overshot 50 million registration, meaning that people who have mobile tend to use the LTE service. The youth and elderly who have low LTE registration rate is replaced by the living population from the Census data. The estimated numbers were rounded from 5 decimal points (e.g. 422.10294 -&gt; 422 persons), therefore the sum of each value may not match the total sum. Foreign residents using either Korean LTE SIM cards or overseas roam service are estimated in the same way as it was for domestic users. You can easily filter foreign population by nationalities. Metropolitan residents are people who live outside Seoul but commute to the city everyday. Because more than 10 million commuters from bed towns - from Gwacheon to airport newtowns near Incheon airport - commute to Seoul, this data gives includes a district code to give an overview of their flows.
