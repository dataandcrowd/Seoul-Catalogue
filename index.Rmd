# Preface {-}

Hello, welcome to this website! This site offers a handful of data from Seoul, including geospatial data,
population, housing, landuse, industry, traffic, society, hospitality, and environment. Note that this page hasn't got
any license to it, so you can look through my explanation and examples, and copy them without permission.
